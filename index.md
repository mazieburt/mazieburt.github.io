### Welcome

Welcome to my page â€“ I am an environmental science major at Southern New Hampshire University.

### Sample Work Products

I'm available for safety-related consulting work in the manufacturing and production fields. Check out [one of my recent safety reports](https://agmath.github.io/PagesBasic/MAT434Final.html) from an incident at Pawtucket Brewery as an example of what I can do for you!
